My name is Tao Tao. I am a PhD student at UNC Chapel Hill. Before graduate school, I worked as a professional software engineer. I am a published author on large-scale, commercial algorithmic systems based on formal methods and parallelism. I am interested in adopting cutting-edge research into daily enterprise practices for technological excellence and commercial success. I am currently building a compiler/programming language for automatic parallelization of programs and high-performance computing, which is also intended to be my PhD thesis.

My resume can be accessed [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/resume2021.pdf).

Most of my interesting code (industry and research) are private by necessity. However, code fragments and private demo are available upon request.

You can find me on LinkedIn via the link in the footer.
