My name is Tao Tao. I am a PhD student at UNC Chapel Hill. Before graduate school, I worked as a professional software engineer. I am a published author on large-scale, commercial algorithmic systems based on formal methods and parallelism. I am interested in adopting cutting-edge research into daily enterprise practices for technological excellence and commercial success. I am currently building a compiler/programming language for automatic parallelization of programs and high-performance computing, which is also intended to be my PhD thesis.
